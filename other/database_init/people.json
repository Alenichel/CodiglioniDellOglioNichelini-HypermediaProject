Korok (testi) e Don Heck (disegni), pubblicato dalla Marvel Comics. La sua prima apparizione avviene in Tales of Suspense (vol. 1[1]) n. 52 (aprile 1964).\n\nAssassina biopotenziata arruolata nel servizio di sicurezza sovietico KGB[4] e punta di diamante dello spionaggio del suo paese durante la guerra fredda, la Vedova Nera è stata a lungo avversaria di Iron Man[5] e dei Vendicatori[6] prima di defezionare per gli Stati Uniti e divenire a sua volta una supereroina, membro sia dei Vendicatori che dello S.H.I.E.L.D.[7] di cui è la sola agente di livello 10[8] oltre a Nick Fury e Quake. Seppur dalla parte del bene, a differenza di molti suoi compagni supereroi, la Vedova Nera utilizza comunque dei metodi estremamente violenti e brutali contro i suoi avversari, non facendosi alcuno scrupolo a torturarli o addirittura ucciderli.\n\nSebbene la traslitterazione scientifica del suo nome sia Natal'ja Al'janovna Romanova (in russo: Наталья Альяновна Романова?) abbreviato in Nataša (in russo: Наташа?), nelle pubblicazioni in lingua italiana, è sempre stata adottata la forma anglicizzata.\n\nNella classifica stilata nel 2011 da IGN, si è posizionata al 74º posto come più grande eroina della storia dei fumetti, dopo Jonah Hex e prima di Marv[9], inoltre è risultata 31ª nella classifica di Comics Buyer's Guide «Le 100 donne più sexy dei fumetti».",
